# byastros
> This project was made for own studies on the Java language and discord bots, having as main search the integration of a NASA API with Discord.
The initial project will be posted on GitHub with just this idea in mind (until now).

```
println ("The purpose of this repository is to keep the project organized for future studies");
```

## Functionalities

The bot sends the image of the day (retrieved from the API) with title and URL via the + apod command on Discord.

## Obs

The project has only 1 current version.
If anyone has an interest in modifying it for their own use, **contact me**.

> "Nothing is created, everything is copied".
